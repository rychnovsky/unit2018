# Development Assignment

## Instructions
You will be developing a React.js app called Eventio which allows registered users to sign up for and create events. The app has to contain 6 pages: Login, Sign Up, Events List, Event Detail, Create Event, User Profile.

## Progress
This project is a bit larger than the previous one, so we have decided to divide it into `stages`. Commit all your changes to a `dev` branch, we are checking these commits as well ;-). When you feel your outcome from the particular stage is done (or almost ready at least :)), create a `pull request` from `dev` to `master` and in the right column select your mentor as a reviewer. You can find your mentor [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15yT3F4OtwyqCiow9syuPS9vqaanjlHJcHKSkExQgvhA/edit#gid=1544649426). Each stage should take you a week.

Stages are following:

### 1st Stage
*Goal:* Prepare static pages and components based on graphic desgin

You should use these libraries:
- [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com)
- [React-Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/)

NOTE: You should create at least all non-public pages (because of following task in 2nd Stage), i.e list with events, event detail, create event and user profile. Login and signup pages will be definitely needed at 3rd Stage (maybe at the end of 2nd). For those students with an extra time - you can prepare all the pages in this stage already, you'll save some time for next stages.

### 2nd Stage
*Goal:* Connect your components to Redux and fill them with dummy data

Needed library:
- [react-redux](http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/UsageWithReact.html)

### 3rd Stage
*Goal:* Hook up your app to real API 

API and its documentation will be revealed later and instructions will be provided by your mentors or by lector during a lesson about Data Fetching, Async Data Flow.

Needed library:
- [redux-sagas](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga)

### 4th Stage
*Goal:* Final touches, testing
